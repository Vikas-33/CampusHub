## Setup Guide

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or higher — download from https://www.python.org/downloads/
- During Python installation on Windows, **check "Add Python to PATH"**

---

### Step 1 — Get the Project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
cd YOUR_REPO_NAME
```

Or click **Code → Download ZIP** on GitHub, extract it, and open a terminal in that folder.

---

### Step 2 — Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate it:

**Windows:**
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

You should see `(venv)` appear in your terminal. ✅

---

### Step 3 — Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### Step 4 — Set Up Environment Variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open the `.env` file in any text editor. It will look like this:

```
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
DEBUG=True
ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1
```

Replace `your-secret-key-here` with any long random string, for example:
```
SECRET_KEY=django-insecure-my-local-college-project-2024
```

It just needs to be long and random. For production, generate one at https://djecrety.ir/

> **Note:** The `.env` file is only on your machine and is never uploaded to GitHub. Every developer creates their own.

---

### Step 5 — Run Migrations

This creates the database tables:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

---

### Step 6 — Create a Superuser (Optional)

Access the Django admin panel at `/admin/`:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

---

### Step 7 — Run the Server

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Open your browser and go to: **http://127.0.0.1:8000**

---

## First Time Usage

1. Go to **http://127.0.0.1:8000/accounts/register/** to register a College account
2. Log in — you'll land on the College Admin dashboard
3. Go to **Teachers → Add Teacher** to create teacher accounts

## Common Issues

**`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'django'`**
→ Virtual environment is not activated. Run `source venv/bin/activate` (Mac/Linux) or `venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows)

**`python` not recognized**
→ Try `python3` instead of `python`

**Port already in use**
→ `python manage.py runserver 8080`

**Migration errors after cloning**
→ Run `python manage.py migrate` — do not delete migration files
